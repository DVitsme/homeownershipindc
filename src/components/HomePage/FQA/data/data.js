    question: "Who gets to be in a study",
    answer:
      "Each research study is different. Each study tries to find answers to a specific question. Researchers must follow strict rules to decide who may take part in research. Not everyone with the situation or problem being studied can take part in a research study. To be included in research, you must agree to take part. You may drop out of a research study at any time, even if you already agreed to participate.Saying no to participating in this research is perfectly ok and will not change anything.If you have questions about participating, I would ask that you contact me and we can discuss your concerns."

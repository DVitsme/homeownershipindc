  "In the United States, to own a home is both an economic and a social indicator of reaching middle-class status. As an economic indicator, owning a home is the primary mechanism for families to accumulate wealth. As a social indicator, homeownership confers social benefits not only to an individual but also to members of the household and the community at large.",
  "The concepts around homeownership have become associated with the  American Dream, and this becomes reinforced by political actors, then translated into federal policy. These policy actions would include the creation of government agencies, tax provisions, and public-private partnerships for community development and funding for homeowners.",
  "While many of the housing policies have been successful in wealth creation and accumulation, the success is not equally distributed. American Black people face a unique set of circumstances that have historically prohibited upward mobility through social stigma, which was reinforced by government policies. While many of these regulations have been physically overturned or deemed unconstitutional, the social stigma has created a vicious housing cycle.",
  "Much of the progress made by American Black households were wiped out by the financial crisis of 2008.  Research has shown if the homeownership rate stayed the same as the rate in 2000, the United States of America would have 770,000 more Black homeowners in 2017.",
  "Housing studies tend to focus the lens of Black homeownership with a problem. Very few studies examine what is right about Black middle-class homeownership. Furthermore, American Black people are frequently stigmatized and portrayed as living below the poverty line, even though seventy-five percent do not.",
  "I want to change that, by researching what works among Black middle-class homeowners. I am interested in learning your perspective of homeownership during a changing city and a changing economic environment.",
  "If you are willing to share your story, I would like to invite you to be part of a doctoral research study affiliated with Walden University. In-person appointments are available at your convenience in a location where you feel most comfortable."
